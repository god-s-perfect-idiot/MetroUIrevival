# MetroUIrevival

A metro UI themed WP like resource pack using Kustom Presets for klck and kwgt. Along with other applications.


### Directories:

##### Functional Apps: 

Apps that work with the latest android versions. 

##### KLCK Lockscreen:

Lockscreen templates made by me and others. Hopefully :)

##### KWGT Widgets: 

Widgets and icons I made using KWGT for any launcher. Works as an impromptu live-tile system.

##### Legacy MetroUI Apps:

Old metro UI inspired apps developed by past enthusiasts that have long been outdated and is just archived abandonware at this point. Most wont even work with the latest versions of android. But for those that does work, Kudos for surviving the test of Time. A14 may not be as kind tho. I collected every little app I remember from my previous attempts at simulating Metro UI on my SGS3, with the exception of Eight Point One R, B, O which where some themes for the CM11. Then again, no one uses CM10, 11 or substratum to apply the themes anymore. So, this folder is basically just sentimental value at this point. Apps like Launcher 8 being non-functional was honestly one of the worst things that ever happened to Android as a whole.

##### Resources: 

Boot animations and sounds as of now. Ill try to find more resources with time. 


### Requirements:

- Android 4.4+
- KLCK
- KLWP


### Credits: 

- Myself as of now.
- Developers of all of these apps, most of which i cant even find a handle or is too lazy to find. Please email me and I'll mention you in the credits.


##### Notes: 

I do not own most of these applications except for maybe some of the widgets and lockscreen.
